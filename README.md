# Crypto Dashboard

This project serves as a practical exercise in API implementation, designed to hone skills in interfacing with external services. To bolster security and enhance code reusability, sensitive information is managed using environment variables. The project is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, providing a scalable and reliable infrastructure for both the project and its Express App backend. API calls are made seamlessly from this hosted environment, ensuring efficient communication with external services.

### What I learned

The original purpose of this project was about safely storing API secrets. Then to enhance the experience I hosted the backend and frontend in an aws ec2 instance. I learned about the use of SSH keys, hot to usea Linux terminal and some practice of Git.
